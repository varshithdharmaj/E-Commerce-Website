Stellar cart - An E-Commerce-Website

üöÄ Project Overview
Stellar Cart is a dynamic and interactive frontend e-commerce application designed to showcase product listings, a functional shopping cart, and a responsive user interface. This project emphasizes modern web development practices, including dynamic content rendering, client-side data management (using Local Storage), and engaging CSS 3D transformations.

It's built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a strong grasp of core frontend technologies.

‚ú® Features
Product Listing: Browse through a curated list of "stellar" products with their names, prices, and images.
Interactive Product Cards: Each product card features a subtle 3D flip effect on click, revealing a detailed description on the back.
Dynamic Shopping Cart:
Add products to the cart with quantity management.
Increase or decrease item quantities directly within the cart.
Automatic calculation and display of the total cart value.
Option to clear the entire cart.
Cart Persistence: The shopping cart contents are saved to and loaded from Local Storage, ensuring items remain in the cart even if the user closes and reopens the browser.
Modal Cart View: A sleek modal window displays the shopping cart, utilizing a 3D scale and rotate transition for a modern reveal effect.
User Feedback: Temporary, animated messages confirm actions like "Product added to cart" or "Cart cleared."
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure for the web page.
CSS3: Styling, layout (Flexbox, Grid), animations, and advanced 3D Transformations (perspective, transform, transform-style: preserve-3d, backface-visibility).
JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic for product rendering, cart management, local storage interaction, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
üèÉ How to Run Locally
Clone the repository (or download the files):
Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd ecommerce-project
Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. No special server setup is required as it's a pure frontend application.
üìù Learning & Development Notes
During the development of Stellar Cart, I focused on:

Reinforcing core JavaScript concepts like array methods (find, reduce), event delegation, and DOM manipulation.
Implementing client-side data persistence using localStorage for a better user experience.
Exploring and applying CSS 3D transforms to create subtle yet engaging UI interactions, demonstrating an understanding of perspective, transform-style, and backface-visibility.
Structuring the JavaScript code into logical functions for better maintainability and readability.
Ensuring the design is responsive across different devices.
üîÆ Future Enhancements
Product Filtering/Sorting: Add options to filter products by category or sort by price/name.
Product Detail Pages: Implement dedicated pages for individual products.
Basic Search Functionality: Allow users to search for products.
More Animations: Introduce additional subtle animations for other UI elements.
Backend Integration (Mock): Simulate API calls to load product data from a mock JSON server.
User Authentication: (More complex) Implement mock user login/registration.
